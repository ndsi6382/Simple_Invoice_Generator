# Simple Invoice Generator

This is a simple (linux) command line program to generate invoices (with the 
Australian options of GST / ABN included). There is also capability to batch 
create invoices from a CSV file. An example of an invoice produced by this 
program can be found in the `./sample_output!` subdirectory.

Invoice parameters are set either inside the program through prompts, or 
through the `config.py` file. The invoice is written in Markdown format, 
before being converted to PDF.
